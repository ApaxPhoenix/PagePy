                ),
                Div(
                    class_name="content",
                    children=[
                        P(children=["This is a paragraph in the main content area."]),
                        Ul(
                            children=[
                                Li(children=["First item"]),
                                Li(children=["Second item"]),
                                Li(children=["Third item"])
                            ]
                        ),
                    ],
                    style={"margin": "20px", "padding": "20px", "border": "1px solid #ddd"}
                ),
                Div(
                    class_name="footer",
                    children=[
                        P(children=["Â© 2024 My Simple Webpage"], style={"text-align": "center"})
                    ],
                    style={
                        "background-color": "#f0f0f0",
                        "padding": "10px",
